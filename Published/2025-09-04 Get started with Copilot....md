Copilot is Microsofts name for their AI offerings, but Copilot isn't just one thing, Copilot really covers a number of things and Microsoft are building Copilot into many of their products in order to assist users being more productive.

Obviously, this post will not dive into the details of every one of these Copilots and the list might not be exhaustive. The above table is just to explain that just because you think you have Copilot, you might have a different Copilot than you expected:-)

## Get the Copilot app

on Android, you will find two Copilot apps from Microsoft:

1. Microsoft Copilot
1. Microsoft 365 Copilot

The difference is that you need a work account (and a qualifying Microsoft 365 subscription) for Microsoft 365 Copilot, whereas Microsoft Copilot is free, requires a Microsoft account only and includes some free quota.

When purchasing Copilot Pro for your personal account, you will get additional quota on both Microsoft Copilot and Microsoft 365 Copilot.

## Use Copilot in Microsoft Edge

You will have the same functionality in the side panel of your Edge browser as you have in the Copilot app. If your browser profile is personal, you will have the Microsoft Copilot functionality and if your browser profile is a work account, you will have the Microsoft 365 Copilot functionality.

Ok... - maybe not that magical.
