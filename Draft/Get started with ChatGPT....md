ChatGPT is the front-end for many of OpenAI's offerings. ChatGPT comes in various flavors, including a free model.

| Plan | Model Access | Usage Limits | Performance | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Free | Limited GPT‑5 | Strict caps | Lower priority | Casual use, exploring AI |
| Plus | GPT‑5 with priority | Higher than Free | Faster, | more reliable | Regular users, creatives |
| Pro | GPT‑5 Pro & advanced | Very high / unlimited | Fastest, | top priority | Power users, developers, heavy AI tasks |
| Business | GPT‑5 Business Tier | Very high / unlimited | High across teams | Teams, enterprises needing admin tools |

Obviously, this post will not dive into the details of every one of these SKUs and the list might even change going forward. The above table is just to explain that just because you think you have ChatGPT, there might be more to the story:-)

## Get the ChatGPT app

In the Microsoft Store on Windows 11, in the Apple App Store on the iPhone or in the Google Play Store on Android, you will find the ChatGPT app from OpenAI, called simply ChatGPT.

When starting the app, you need to login / sign up to ChatGPT. You can use an email address and a password to login (and add multi factor authentication preferably) or you can login using your Google account, your Windows account, your Apple account or using a phone number and a password.

## Use ChatGPT in a browser

If you prefer not to download the app, you can also open https://chatgpt.com in a browser and get the same experience there. In a browser you can also use ChatGPT anonymously, but then it doesn't have any history and you have very limited access to the functionality
